# Responsive Web Design Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates a responsive multi-section webpage built using modern CSS layout techniques—**Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**—alongside **Responsive Web Design (RWD)** principles. The layout adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, showcasing thoughtful content placement and flexible design.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- No external libraries or frameworks

## 📐 Layout Structure
The webpage includes the following sections:
- **Header**: Site title
- **Navigation Bar**: Horizontally aligned links using Flexbox
- **Main Content Area**: Two-column layout using CSS Grid
  - Primary content section
  - Sidebar section
- **Footer**: Simple copyright notice

## 📱 Responsive Design
Media queries are used to adjust layout and typography for different screen sizes:
- **Tablet (≤768px)**: Grid layout collapses to single column; navigation becomes vertical
- **Mobile (≤480px)**: Font sizes and spacing scale down for readability

## 💡 Key Features
- ✅ Flexbox for horizontal/vertical alignment in navigation
- ✅ CSS Grid for 2D layout of main content and sidebar
- ✅ Responsive units (`rem`, `%`, `gap`) for scalable spacing
- ✅ Clean, maintainable CSS with comments for clarity

## 📂 Files Included
- `index.html`: HTML structure of the webpage
- `style.css`: CSS styling with layout and responsiveness

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. Resize the browser window to see responsive behavior
